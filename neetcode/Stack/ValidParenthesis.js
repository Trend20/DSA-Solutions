// STACK(LIFO => Last In First Out)
/*
In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with two principal operations:
a). push, which adds an element to the collection,
b). pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed
Additionally, peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.

// EXAMPLE CHALLENGE
/*
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
