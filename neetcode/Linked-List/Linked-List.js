/*
In computer science, a Linked-list is a linear collection of data elements in which linear order is not given by their physical 
placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next one.
This data structure consist of a group of nodes which together forms a sequence.

BigO notation for different operations on Linked List
access = O(n)
insert = O(1)
delete = 0(n)
search = O(n)
